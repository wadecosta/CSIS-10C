/******************Problem 1 *******************
// Run this program taken from the lecture slides then modify so it   
//  a) asks the user to input a height in feet
//  b) inputs a value and stores it in variable feet
// You will now have an interactive program that converts feet to inches

int feet, inches;
cout << "Enter a height in feet :";
cin >> feet;
inches = feet * 12;
cout << "Height is " << inches << " in.";


//******************End Problem 1***********************/
/******************Problem 2  ***************
// This program converts yards to feet. 
//   A) Fix the one compiler error so it runs
//   B) Change the variables x and y to more meaningful names

/******************Problem 8 (2 points)*****************
// Write a program that can be used to calculate an employee paycheck. 
// Your programs should input two numbers: the number of hours worked 
// and the hourly rate. (see test plan)

// Write a program that asks the user to input a length
//  and width of a rectangle.  The program should 
//  then calculate and output both the area (length x width)
